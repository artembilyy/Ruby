=begin
1. Write code that splits a given array of integers into two arrays; 
the first containing odd numbers and second containing even numbers.
=end

2. Given an arrayÂ [1, 2, 34, 5, 6, 7, 8 ,9], 
sum it up using a method

3. Remove choose letter from the string
=end

puts "# Third Task"
puts "Enter word here..."
string = gets.chomp
puts "Enter character(s) to delete..."
remove_characters = gets.chomp
result = string.gsub(remove_characters, "")
